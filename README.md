# Linear Regression Analysis on Diabetes Dataset

## Description

In this project, I explore a dataset from a diabetes study, rich in variables that span demographic data, physical measurements, clinical indicators, and lifestyle factors. This dataset serves as a robust foundation for understanding the dynamics of diabetes, a prevalent and impactful chronic condition. My analysis primarily focuses on glycosylated hemoglobin (glyhb) levels, a crucial biomarker for diabetes control and diagnosis.

My approach involves a series of linear regression models, where I meticulously explore the relationships between glyhb levels and various potential predictors. The project begins with a thorough exploratory data analysis, including correlation studies and detailed visualizations to grasp the underlying data patterns. I then delve into advanced statistical techniques like the Box-Cox transformation to address non-normal distributions in the response variable, enhancing the robustness of my linear models.

The heart of the analysis lies in building and refining multiple linear regression models. By doing so, I try to isolate significant predictors of glyhb levels. This process involves rigorous testing and validation, including diagnostic checks for assumptions of linear regression such as homoscedasticity, normality of residuals, and multicollinearity. I also engage in identifying and addressing outliers and leverage points, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of my findings.

This project demonstrates my ability to navigate complex datasets, utilize advanced statistical techniques, and interpret data in a meaningful way. My adept use of linear regression models and transformations like Box-Cox showcases my skill in statistical analysis. This work exemplifies my capacity to translate data insights into practical applications, particularly in healthcare research. 

# Installation and Setup

To run this project, ensure you have R installed. Required R packages include:

1. 'ggplot2' for data visualization
2. 'MASS' for the Box-Cox transformation
3. 'glmnet' for ridge and LASSO regression
4. Install these packages using install.packages("package_name").

# Usage
Run the scripts in the following order:

1. Data exploration and splitting
2. Linear regression modeling
3. Model selection and validation
   
Scripts are designed to take you from raw data analysis to final model selection.

# Data
The project uses the "diabetes.txt" dataset. It includes various health-related predictors and glyhb as a response variable. The data is split into training and test sets for model validation.
